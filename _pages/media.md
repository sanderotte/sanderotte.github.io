On Wednesday September 11th 2019, Sander Otte gave his inaugural lecture as Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Professor. During his 30-minutes public lecture (in Dutch), he took his audience to the border between classical physics and quantum physics. Highlight of the lecture was a live demonstration of an experiment on structures of actual magnetic atoms, positioned in such a way as to visualize this border.<br /><br />

### 'The kilobyte'

In 2016, in a [Nature Nanotechnology](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nnano.2016.131) paper by Floris Kalff and coworkers, we demonstrated the possibility to store a full kilobyte of data in a device where each of the 8,000 bits is represented by the position of a single atom. This short video explains the finding in an accessible manner.<br /><br />

As described in this [Physics Today](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/PT.5.8182) article, the work gained significant attention in the international news, including stories in [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2016/07/23/atoms-and-the-voids), [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiny-hard-drive-uses-single-atoms-to-store-data-1468854001) and [Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/record-setting-hard-drive-writes-information-one-atom-a-1783740015). Below, you can download two high-resolution versions of the iconic STM images of the memory: 'Feynman' (annotated) and 'Darwin'. Please let us know if you plan to use them.
