## Open positions
<br />

### Postdoc and PhD student positions on coherent spin dynamics

We currently have openings for a postdoc and a PhD student in our group. Each will be working on research related to coherent spin dynamics and ESR-STM (electron spin resonance scanning tunneling microscopy). See below for details.
<br />
<br />

#### Research

STM allows for the study of magnetism on the smallest scale: the scale of individual atoms. In recent years, ESR-STM dramatically expanded possibilities by enabling quantum coherent spin manipulation in such atoms. Building further on this framework, our group developed unique methodology to trace the free time evolution of coupled spins using a combination of ESR-STM and very fast DC pulses. This methodology forms the basis for future research on the coherent quantum dynamics of extended spin systems, such as 2D lattices and atomic scale quantum information devices. We are currently also expanding our activities in the direction of hyperfine interactions (i.e. nuclear spin manipulation and readout) and non-contact atomic force microscopy (AFM).

#### Job description / requirements

<br /><i>**PhD student**</i><br />
You will work on a dedicated research project expanding on our latest results. The exact project can be discussed and might evolve as the rapidly expanding field develops. As such, you will be given a lot of freedom in shaping your PhD thesis.

We are looking for an enthusiastic candidate with an MSc degree in physics or a closely related field. Knowledge of quantum mechanics and solid state physics is highly valued. General experience with experimental physics is preferred, but prior experience with specific techniques such as STM is not required.

The contract will be for 4 years with an official go/no go assessment after the first year. Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. The application will remain open until a suitable candidate has been found.

<br /><i>**Postdoc**</i><br />
As a postdoc you will fulfil an overarching role in the research of our group. In addition to running your own research, you will guide one or more PhD students with their projects. You will also be involved in identifying and developing strategies for future research directions.

The ideal candidate has research experience in a field related to ESR and/or quantum information. Experience with low-temperature STM is desired but not mandatory. The initial contract will be for 2 years. Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. The application will remain open until a suitable candidate has been found.

#### About our group

We are a focused research group operating two low temperature (1K or below) STM systems equipped with superconducting magnets. We recently upgraded both systems to be compatible with GHz-range radio frequency (RF) signals, bringing them to a state-of-the-art level. In addition, we have acquired high-end RF equipment including a sub-nanosecond arbitrary waveform generator.

The Otte Lab is part of the department of Quantum Nanoscience in the Kavli Institute of Nanoscience at Delft University of Technology. Delft is a lively university town close to larger cities as The Hague and Rotterdam (both ~15 minutes by train) and with Amsterdam within about an hour train distance.

#### BSc / MSc students

Our group always has (limited) availability for graduation projects. If you are looking for a bachelor or master project, feel free to contact any of our group members for information.
