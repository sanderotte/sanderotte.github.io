  headline: "Today in [Science](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abg8223), Lukas Veldman and coworkers demonstrate a new method to trace the coherent dynamics of two coupled atomic spins. The technique, which could be described as a means to overhear a conversation between the atoms, was covered in many news outlets including [Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/physicists-caught-two-atoms-talking-to-each-other-1846967872)."
